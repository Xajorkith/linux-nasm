Hello.
Recently i took asm again, i needed one example to use graphics on linux and assembly. i found yours, thanks.
On file x11hello.asm, there is one error, this:
.break:
mov   rdi, qword[d]
call  XCloseDisplay

must be changed to:

.break:
mov   rsp, rbp
pop   rbp
mov   rdi, qword[d]
call  XCloseDisplay

Whitout this lines, an 'Segment fault' occurs.

I didn,t found your mail to tell it to you.
